# **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes sentiment in social media posts using **Python**, leveraging powerful libraries like **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. The goal is to classify posts as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral** and extract meaningful insights from audience sentiment.  

## 🔍 **Objective**  
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** on real-world social media text data  
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand sentiment distribution  
- Use **visualizations** to identify trends and patterns in audience emotions  
- Provide **data-driven insights** for improving social media engagement  

## 📂 **Dataset**  
The dataset contains the following columns:  
- **text** – Social media post content  
- **sentiment** – Labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral  

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  

## 📊 **Key Insights**  
- Majority of posts show **positive sentiment**, indicating strong brand perception.  
- Negative sentiments highlight key areas for **improvement in engagement strategies**.  
- Neutral sentiments often represent informational posts or automated responses.  

## 🚀 **Next Steps**  
- Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for deeper sentiment analysis.  
- Use **Machine Learning models** to predict sentiment automatically.  
- Expand analysis to different platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
